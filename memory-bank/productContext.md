# Product Context

**Why this project exists:**
`mockloop-mcp` exists to accelerate software development and testing cycles by providing instant, configurable mock APIs. In modern development, frontend and backend teams often work in parallel, and dependencies on yet-to-be-completed or unstable backend services can cause significant delays. This project aims to remove such bottlenecks.

**How users benefit from it:**
Users (developers, QA engineers) benefit in several ways:
- **Faster Iteration:** Develop and test applications that consume APIs without waiting for the actual backend to be ready or stable.
- **Simplified Testing:** Easily create consistent and predictable API responses for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Parallel Development:** Frontend teams can build UIs against a functional mock API while backend teams implement the real services.
- **Isolation:** Test specific components in isolation by mocking their external API dependencies.
- **Reduced Costs:** Avoids costs associated with hitting rate-limited or paid third-party APIs during development and testing.
- **Offline Development:** Work on API-dependent features even without internet access to a live API.

**How it should work (User Flow):**
1. The user invokes an MCP tool provided by `mockloop-mcp`.
2. The tool accepts an API specification as input. This can be a URL pointing to an online specification (e.g., OpenAPI JSON/YAML) or a path to a local specification file.
3. `mockloop-mcp` parses this specification.
4. Based on the parsed data, it generates a complete, runnable FastAPI application. This application will contain mock endpoints corresponding to those defined in the specification.
5. The generated mock server will include:
    - Basic mock responses for each endpoint.
    - Comprehensive request/response logging middleware.
    - A `Dockerfile` for containerization.
    - A `docker-compose.yml` for easy execution.
6. The MCP tool then provides the user with the path to the generated mock server code and instructions on how to run it (e.g., using Docker Compose or directly via Uvicorn).
7. The user can then start the mock server and direct their application or tests to its endpoints.
