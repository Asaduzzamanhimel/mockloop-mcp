# Project Brief

**Goal:** To create an MCP server named `mockloop-mcp`.

**Problem Solved:** `mockloop-mcp` automates the generation and execution of mock API servers directly from API documentation (initially focusing on OpenAPI/Swagger specifications). This enables developers to quickly obtain a functional mock environment for development and testing purposes, reducing dependencies on live backend systems and facilitating parallel workflows.
