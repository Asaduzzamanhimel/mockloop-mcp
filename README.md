## Installation

To get started with Mockloop MCP, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Asaduzzamanhimel/mockloop-mcp/releases). Download the appropriate file for your operating system, and follow the instructions below to set it up.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **OpenAPI Spec**: Have your OpenAPI specification ready to generate the mock server.

### Steps to Install

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Asaduzzamanhimel/mockloop-mcp/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the unzipped folder.
5. Run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now your Mockloop MCP server is up and running!

## Usage

### Generating a Mock Server

To generate a mock server, you need to have your OpenAPI specification file ready. The following command will help you create a mock server from your OpenAPI spec:

```bash
npm run generate -- path/to/your/openapi-spec.yaml
```

Replace `path/to/your/openapi-spec.yaml` with the actual path to your OpenAPI specification file.

### Accessing the Mock Server

Once the server is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`. You can make requests to your mock endpoints just like you would with a real API.

### Logging and Analytics

The server logs all requests and responses. You can view the logs in your terminal. Additionally, performance analytics are available to help you understand how your mock server is performing.

### Server Discovery

Mockloop MCP supports server discovery. If you have multiple mock servers running, you can use the discovery feature to find and connect to them easily.

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the [API Documentation](docs/api.md). This document outlines all available endpoints, request/response formats, and example use cases.
